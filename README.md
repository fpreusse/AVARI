# AVARI
Supplementary material for the article "Anytime-valid simultanoeus lower confidence bounds for the true discovery proportion". A preprint of this article is available at https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2505.17803. 
In particular, the R-Code used for the simulation study is available. Furhtermore, the functions used in the case study are also given. The file "Basis_functions.R" contains the functions needed for the simulation study and the case study. The file "Simulation_Study.R" contains the exact code used in the simulation study, as well as code for the evaluation of the simulated observations.

AVARI stands for anytime-valid all resolution inference.
