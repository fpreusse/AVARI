# AVARI
Supplementary material for the article "Anytime-valid simultanoeus lower confidence bounds for the true discovery proportion". A preprint of this article is available at https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2505.17803. In this article, a method is proposed that combines the closed testing framework with the concept of safe anytime-valid inference (SAVI) to compute lower confidence bounds for the true discovery proportion in a multiple testing setting. The proposed procedure provides confidence bounds that are valid at every observation time point and that are simultaneous for all possible subsets of hypotheses, allowing for all-resolution inference (ARI). While the hypotheses are assumed to be fixed over time, the subsets of interest may vary. 

In this repository, the R-Code used for the simulation study is available, as well as the R functions used in the case study (application of the proposed method to functional magnetic resonance imaging). The file "Basis_functions.R" contains the functions needed for the simulation study and the case study. The file "Simulation_Study.R" contains the exact code used in the simulation study, as well as code for the evaluation of the simulated observations.

AVARI stands for anytime-valid all resolution inference.
